Comparison of random and minimax algorithms:

(the results are taken from left to right 0 to 8 taken boxes in ms)

Random AI :
[0.006131, 0.005049, 0.005612, 0.005235, 0.005382, 0.006144, 0.00522, 0.0059, 0.00518]
It mainly remains the same time as it just takes random cells

Minimax AI :
[6977.61376, 576.0334502, 78.861423, 10.516752, 1.096230, 0.243722, 0.087030, 0.051621, 0.0007352]
It is seen its faster because it needs fewer  models to predict the best step out of all possible steps in the algorithm
