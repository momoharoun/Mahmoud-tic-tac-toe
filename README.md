WEEK 5: 
I used Classmates as referance throughout this part:

I refered to my classmate Ivan profiling code and implemented mine from his, however I was stuck before starting this part and didnt know what to do and his code has helped me understand and grasp the last part of the project :)


ANY EXTRA COMMENTS: 
Some handy functions that you might need to play the game:
press R to restart the game
press p to play player v player 
press q to quit the game a whole :)
press 0 to play against random AI
press 1 to play againt uneatable AI 

And lastly this project was really fun and has really opened my eyes on coding but also teamwork and asking people when in need and not being shy and that we are all in the end here to learn. :)
Thank you!
